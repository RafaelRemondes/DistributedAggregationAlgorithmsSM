abstract = {Smart meter is an advanced energy meter that measures consumption of electrical energy providing additional information compared to a conventional energy meter. Integration of smart meters into electricity grid involves implementation of a variety of techniques and software, depending on the features that the situation demands. Design of a smart meter depends on the requirements of the utility company as well as the customer. This paper discusses various features and technologies that can be integrated with a smart meter. In fact, deployment of smart meters needs proper selection and implementation of a communication network satisfying the security standards of smart grid communication. This paper outlines various issues and challenges involved in design, deployment, utilization, and maintenance of the smart meter infrastructure. In addition, several applications and advantages of smart meter, in the view of future electricity market are discussed in detail. This paper explains the importance of introducing smart meters in developing countries. In addition, the status of smart metering in various countries is also illustrated.},

The report first outlines the potential benefits of smart meters for consumers, suppliers, metering companies, distribution network operators and public interest. Next the report provides a short overview of the legal framework governing metering activities in Europe, as well as a review of smart metering policies, a summary of regulatory and legislative tools and an analysis of cases in selected countries. Drawing from the experiences to date, the report concludes with a set of recommendations for policy makers to consider when developing a smart metering programme and the regulatory approaches that could be adopted at national and/or EU level to encourage compatibility of smart metering solutions and to accelerate implementation of smart meters and smart grids.},

@article{Ericsson_2,
    abstract = {{AThe introduction of  ” smart grid” solutions imposes that cyber security and power system communication systems must be dealt with extensively. These parts together are essential for proper electricity transmission, where the information infrastructure is critical. The development of communication capabilities, moving power control systems from  ” islands of automation” to totally integrated computer environments, have opened up new possibilities and vulnerabilities. Since several power control systems have been procured with  ” openness” requirements, cyber security threats become evident. For refurbishment of a SCADA/EMS system, a separation of the operational and administrative computer systems must be obtained. The paper treats cyber security issues, and it highlights access points in a substation. Also, information security domain modeling is treated. Cyber security issues are important for  ” smart grid” solutions. Broadband communications open up for smart meters, and the increasing use of wind power requires a  ” smart grid system”.}},

  abstract = {End-to-end encryption for wireless sensor networks is a challenging
  problem. To save the overall energy resources of the network it is
  agreed that sensed data need to be consolidated and aggregated on
  their way to the final destination. For such circumstances we present
  an approach that conceals sensed and aggregated data end-to-end.
  Even the aggregating intermediate nodes are not enabled to read the
  sensed plaintext data. We apply a particular class of encryption
  transformation and exemplary discuss the approach on the basis of
  two aggregation functions. We show their appliance in hierarchical
  aggregator topologies and use actual implementation to show that
  the approach is feasible and frequently even more energy efficient
  than hop-by-hop encryption addressing a much weaker attacker model.},
